# Leaderboard
In this activity I setted up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality.l consumed the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
